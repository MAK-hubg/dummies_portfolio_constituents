Description: What the package does (The package is build to convert constituents of an index or a portfolio provided by Refinitiv/CRSP to times series of dummies in xts-format. The Refinitiv data has/should have three variables named: 'in_out' (Showing "+" for securities when included in the portfolio and "-" when excluded), 'RIC' codes which identify each constituent of the portfolio distinctively and 'date' variable that records date of inclusion or exclusion when read in conjunction with in_out for corresponding security. The CRSP data also has three variable: the ID as gvkey or ticker, date_in and date_out).
